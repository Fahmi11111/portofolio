Legion Commander Roles: Carry / Disabler / Initiator / Durable / Nuker They came
without warning. Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a
terrible sound, and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering
beyond count, wielding flame and foul sorcery, slaying and snatching mothers and
sons to dark purpose. Fight me! Shadow Shaman Roles: Support / Pusher / Disabler
/ Nuker / Initiator Born in the Bleeding Hills, Rhasta was just a starving
youngling when picked up by a travelling con-man. For two pins of copper, the
old con-man would tell your fortune. For three, he'd castrate your pig, for
five, he'd circumcise your sons. For a good meal, he'd don his shaman garb, read
from his ancient books, and lay a curse upon your enemies. Press the Attack!
